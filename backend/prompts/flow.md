<answer1>We're going to invest in American workers and American ingenuity. We need to build infrastructure like roads, bridges, universal broadband. We'll lower taxes for the middle class and make corporations pay their fair share. And I'll fight against outsourcing and make sure more products are stamped Made in America.</answer1>
<answer2>We're going to cut taxes massively and unleash the power of the American economy. We need to eliminate burdensome regulations that are stifling small businesses. I'll 
renegotiate bad trade deals and bring jobs back from China. And we'll invest in job training so Americans have the skills they need.</answer2>
<rebuttal1>While cutting some taxes may provide a short-term boost, we can't afford to add more to the deficit. The real way to grow the economy is to invest in working families or they'll continue to fall behind.</rebuttal1>
<rebuttal2>Lowering taxes and cutting regulations is the proven recipe for job creation and economic growth. We just need to get government out of the way and let the American people and American businesses do what they do best</rebuttal2>
